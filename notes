reducer
	- function that returns a piece of the application state
	- our app can have many pieces of state ergo it can have many reducers
	- step one is making the reducer, step 2 is connecting it to the application
container (smart components)
	- React component that has a direction connection to the state through redux
	- in general, we want the most parent component that cares about a particulat piece of state to be a container/is connected to redux.
