reducer
	- function that returns a piece of the application state
	- our app can have many pieces of state ergo it can have many reducers
	- step one is making the reducer, step 2 is connecting it to the application
container (smart components)
	- React component that has a direction connection to the state through redux
	- in general, we want the most parent component that cares about a particulat piece of state to be a container/is connected to redux.
action creators
	- a function that returns an action
	- that action is then sent through all the applications reducers
	- reducers can choose to return a new piece of state depending on what the action is
		- once the action has run through all the reducers, the new pieces of state are then pumped back into the app, causing relevant components to re-render.
		- reducers do not have to react to every action, they can return their original state
